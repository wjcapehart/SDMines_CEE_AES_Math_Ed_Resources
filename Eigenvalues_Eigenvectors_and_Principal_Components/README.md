# Application for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors using Principal Component Analysis

Designed for AES 420/520

Needs examples of crunching these fields.  I can do this with satellite imagey (example in powerpoint) but I want more examples

May hit up Scott K. for examples since he has used this in hydrology with Jemie a while back.
