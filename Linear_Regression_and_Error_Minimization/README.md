# Linear Regression, Confidence Limits and Least-Squared Error Minimization

Designed for CEE 284 with Mathcad and R (also for Math 442)

Does a simple small-sample linear regression to demonstrate Matchad's intrinsic linear regression functions.

Includes SSR, SST and r2/skill.

Also has some call-forwarding to solving systems of multiple equations.

The R example is for multivariate linear regression.
