# Euler's and Runge Kutta's methods

Designed for CEE 284, AES 740 and AES 615

Includes a slide show illulstrating graphically how Euler and Runge Kutta work.

Mathcad examples include a simple coding example and how to use the intrinsic Mathcad Prime features to solve differential equations

To go more hardcore (complete with optional body count), see the section on "Modeling_Forward_in_Time" for an example using disease modeling
