# Modeling Differential Equations with Euler's and Runge Kutta's methods

Designed for AES/CEE 619 with Stella and CEE 284 with Mathcad

Uses a classic Susceptable-Infected-Recovered (SIR) disease model to demonstrate Euler's method in modeling differential equations

Also includes a powerpoint on how we develop and use these equations.

Includes two Stella Models showing a short-term outbreak and long-term outbreak that includes births, natural deaths and the loss of immunity over time

A R noteboook is also currently available to demonstrate [mis]using R as a programming language.

CEE 284 students slowly and incrementally develop this model following a simple Euler's method script developed beforehand.
